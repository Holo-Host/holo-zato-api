# Holo Zato API Test

**Note: You will need an `env` file with API keys in it.  They are not stored in this repo.**

## How To

1. run `make build`
2. write tests in the `/tests` dir per `https://zato.io/docs/test/apitest/index.html`
3. run `make test` 
4. write more tests, run `make build` then `make test`.  You can run `make` which will perform both build and test sequentially.
